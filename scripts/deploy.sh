# Copy the TwitchEmotes addon folder into a WoW Forever (Camelot) client on a
# Windows machine reachable over ssh. Files are streamed with tar, so the game
# can keep running; new or changed files are picked up on the next
# logout/login (a brand-new addon needs a trip to the character screen, a
# .toc change needs a full client restart).
#
# Usage: scripts/deploy.sh [ssh-host] [addons-dir]
#   ssh-host    defaults to mizepc (the author's machine)
#   addons-dir  defaults to the Battle.net default install path for the
#               Forever beta: C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\_classic_beta_\Interface\AddOns
# Both arguments are trusted operator input; they are interpolated into the
# remote command lines, so quote characters and shell metacharacters are refused.
